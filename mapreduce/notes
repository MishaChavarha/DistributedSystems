protoc compiler places generated code inside output directory and rust-analyzer does not find it.

The plan.
Master is listening for RPC calls from the workers. 
Worker asks master for a task. Worker reads task input. 
Executes task and writes task to one or more files. 
Master should notice if task is not completed within, say 10 seconds.
Master can abort the task and can give the same task to a different 
worker. 


Master acts a server for worker RPC calls. Master listens for worker incomming connections.
We can assume that required files are sitting on the same filesystem, so master responds with 
a file id.

Worker requests the task. master sends address of a file. Worker does the work.
